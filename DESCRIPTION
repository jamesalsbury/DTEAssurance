Description: Provides functions for planning clinical trials
    subject to a delayed treatment effect using assurance-based methods.
    Includes two 'shiny' applications that use these functions for
    interactive exploration, simulation, and visualisation of trial designs
    and outcomes. The methodology is described in:
