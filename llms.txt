# DTEAssurance

**DTEAssurance** is an R package for implementing assurance methodology
in the design of clinical trials with an anticipated delayed treatment
effect (DTE).  
It uses elicited prior distributions—via the
[`SHELF`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SHELF) framework—for the
delay duration and post-delay hazard ratio, and simulates operating
characteristics to inform trial design.

The methodology is based on the following papers:

- Salsbury JA, Oakley JE, Julious SA, Hampson LV.  
  [Assurance methods for designing a clinical trial with a delayed
  treatment
  effect](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.10136).

## Assurance Methods for Delayed Treatment Effects

### `Shiny` App

Launch the interactive app to explore assurance under delayed treatment
effects:

``` r
DTEAssurance::assurance_shiny_app()
```

### Offline Example

You can also use the package offline via the main function:

``` r
DTEAssurance::calc_dte_assurance()
```

This function requires the following arguments:

- `n_c`: Number of patients in the control group
- `n_t`: Number of patients in the treatment group
- `control_model`: A named list specifying the control arm survival
  distribution
- `effect_model`: A named list specifying beliefs about the treatment
  effect
- `censoring_model`: A named list specifying the censoring mechanism
- `recruitment_model`: A named list specifying the recruitment process
- `analysis_model`: A named list specifying the statistical test and
  decision rule
- `n_sims`: Number of simulations to run

An example of this is shown:

``` r
control_model <- list(dist = "Exponential", parameter_mode = "Fixed", fixed_type = "Parameters", lambda = 0.1)
effect_model <- list(delay_SHELF = SHELF::fitdist(c(3, 4, 5), probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), lower = 0, upper = 10),
delay_dist = "gamma",
HR_SHELF = SHELF::fitdist(c(0.55, 0.6, 0.7), probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), lower = 0, upper = 1.5),
HR_dist = "gamma",
P_S = 1, P_DTE = 0)
censoring_model <- list(method = "Time", time = 12)
recruitment_model <- list(method = "power", period = 12, power = 1)
analysis_model <- list(method = "LRT", alpha = 0.025, alternative_hypothesis = "one.sided")
result <- calc_dte_assurance(n_c = 300, n_t = 300,
                             control_model = control_model,
                             effect_model = effect_model,
                             censoring_model = censoring_model,
                             recruitment_model = recruitment_model,
                             analysis_model = analysis_model,
                             n_sims = 100)

str(result)
#> List of 4
#>  $ assurance  : num 0.83
#>  $ CI         : num [1, 1:2] 0.742 0.898
#>  $ duration   : num 12
#>  $ sample_size: num 600
```

We can vary the sample sizes and plot the resulting output:

``` r

result <- calc_dte_assurance(n_c = seq(50, 500, by = 50),
                             n_t = seq(50, 500, by = 50),
                             control_model = control_model,
                             effect_model = effect_model,
                             censoring_model = censoring_model,
                             recruitment_model = recruitment_model,
                             analysis_model = analysis_model,
                             n_sims = 500)
```

## Assurance for DTE - With Group Sequential Designs

### `Shiny` App

Launch the interactive `shiny` app to explore assurance under delayed
treatment effects using group sequential designs:

``` r
DTEAssurance::assurance_GSD_shiny_app()
```

### Offline Example

You can also use the package offline via the main function:

``` r
DTEAssurance::calc_dte_assurance_interim()
```

This function requires the following arguments:

- `n_c`: Number of patients in the control group
- `n_t`: Number of patients in the treatment group
- `control_model`: A named list specifying the control arm survival
  distribution
- `effect_model`: A named list specifying beliefs about the treatment
  effect
- `recruitment_model`: A named list specifying the recruitment process
- `GSD_model`: A named list specifying the group sequential design
- `n_sims`: Number of simulations to run

An example of this is shown:

``` r
control_model <- list(dist = "Exponential", parameter_mode = "Fixed", fixed_type = "Parameters", lambda = 0.08)
effect_model <- list(delay_SHELF = SHELF::fitdist(c(3, 4, 5), probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), lower = 0, upper = 10),
delay_dist = "gamma",
HR_SHELF = SHELF::fitdist(c(0.55, 0.6, 0.7), probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), lower = 0, upper = 1.5),
HR_dist = "gamma",
P_S = 0.9, P_DTE = 0.7)
recruitment_model <- list(method = "power", period = 12, power = 1)
GSD_model <- list(events = 450, alpha_spending = c("0.01, 0.025"),
                  beta_spending = c("0.05, 0.1"), IF_vec = c("0.5, 1"))
result <- calc_dte_assurance_interim(n_c = 300, n_t = 300,
                             control_model = control_model,
                             effect_model = effect_model,
                             recruitment_model = recruitment_model,
                             GSD_model = GSD_model,
                             n_sims = 500)

str(result)
#> 'data.frame':    500 obs. of  6 variables:
#>  $ Trial         : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
#>  $ IF            : chr  "0.5, 1" "0.5, 1" "0.5, 1" "0.5, 1" ...
#>  $ Decision      : chr  "Successful at final" "Stop for efficacy" "Stop for futility" "Stop for futility" ...
#>  $ StopTime      : num  27.1 13.6 12.5 12.9 13.7 ...
#>  $ SampleSize    : int  600 600 600 600 600 600 600 600 600 600 ...
#>  $ Final_Decision: chr  "Successful" "Successful" "Successful" "Successful" ...
```

If we wish to compare the operating characteristics we can do so by
changing the `GSD_model` and plotting the proportion of outcomes:

``` r

GSD_model <- list(events = 450, 
                  alpha_spending = c("0.01, 0.025", "0.01, 0.025", "0.01, 0.025"),
                  beta_spending = c("0.05, 0.1", "0.05, 0.1", "0.05, 0.1"), 
                  IF_vec = c("0.25, 1", "0.5, 1", "0.75, 1"))

result <- calc_dte_assurance_interim(n_c = 300, n_t = 300,
                             control_model = control_model,
                             effect_model = effect_model,
                             recruitment_model = recruitment_model,
                             GSD_model = GSD_model,
                             n_sims = 500)
```
